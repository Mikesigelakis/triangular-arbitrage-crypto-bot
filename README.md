Sure, here's an example documentation for your triangular-arbitrage-crypto-bot repository:

# Triangular Arbitrage Crypto Bot

This repository contains a Python-based bot that finds triangular arbitrage opportunities in the Bittrex crypto market. The bot uses the Bittrex API to fetch real-time price data for selected cryptocurrency pairs, then calculates the potential profit that could be earned through triangular arbitrage.

## Requirements

To use this bot, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Bittrex API key and secret
- Pandas and websockets libraries

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```
pip install pandas websockets
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace the dummy API key and secret in the `api_key.py` file with your own Bittrex API key and secret.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder.
4. Run the following command to start the bot:

```
python triangular_arbitrage.py
```

The bot will start fetching real-time price data for selected cryptocurrency pairs and calculating the potential profit from triangular arbitrage. If an arbitrage opportunity is found, the bot will place orders to execute the trade automatically.

## Limitations

- This bot only works with the Bittrex crypto market.
- Triangular arbitrage opportunities may be limited, and the potential profit may be small.
- The bot is provided "as is" and there is no guarantee of accuracy or reliability. Use at your own risk.
